# Churned customers clustering and regression

## Clustering on the data returned by the following SQL queries: 1) v2_detailed_cohort_stage_2, and 2) People who order within every 2 months with segments

## Used various methods for determining the right number of clusters with K-Means such as 1) elbow chart method, 2) Gap statistics, 3) Silhoutette method, and 4) Dendrograms

### Result: List of customers in each segment, and the characteristics of the segments help frane the survey-email copy and the survey questions.
### Thus, in a way, we are pre-segmenting the customers according to their purchasing habits and what application types they purchased (can be known by using filters in this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1cSBQIUrh9EuvAq0xEyJ6pTEKcKNy0-OkNtcqBgQ9snM/edit) which has the results exported from this R script
